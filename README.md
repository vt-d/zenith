# Zenith language

This is a simple toy language im creating for the sake of learning how to make a decently complex language that can be actually used. It will use cranelift as the main backend... Maybe will implement LLVM using inkwell in the future. JIT will also be the main method that ill focusing on.

Things to be done:
[x] AST
[x] Lexer
[] Parser
[] JIT
[] Compilation

Things that are checked means that the tests have passed. Beware that this is not meant for production use.
There are no proper integration tests.

Language docs (written by ChatGPT) over at DOCS.md (faulty af but gets the job done)
Language syntax designed by me :3

Thank you `logos` for making parsing so easy
